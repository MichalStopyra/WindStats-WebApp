There are two types of wind in Tarifa, the famous Levante wind and the less well known Poniente. Levante is a beast. It blows at times for 24h a day for weeks at a time. If you are staying in Tarifa, it is pretty brutal. It is a very gusty wind blowing up to 45kn! It is a very warm wind though. This means you can roam around in just board shorts/bikini all day. Poniente is much more gentle. A more humid sea-breeze that blows on average around 20kn. However, it is a lot colder. At times it can be ten degrees cooler! A jumper will be needed from September up to May...
