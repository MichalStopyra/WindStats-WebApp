Risco is where all the magic happens. This is where you want to windsurf. This spot will get in your consciusness after you see it at its full beauty. The big lagoon which fills on high tide is pefect for learning and progressing. Imagine your kids playing and windsurfing in it while you can go speed racing on your own outside of the lagoon. Too good to be true. If you want to freestyle than for you is better mid-tide. This is how it works and no explanation needed. Letâ€™s just say you will stay in Risco and windsurf your heart out till the dark with amazing sunset sessions and your own gear, beacause unfortunately the center closes when the nicest session begin.
