The most common wind direction in El Médano is side-onshore from the left. This comes due to the trade winds (Pasat or Aliseos) that hit the island from the north-east. This in itself is a pretty reliable wind direction which would be a great thing in itself. However, there is a nice bonus to having Spain’s tallest mountain here.
One of the biggest hurdles for most people visiting El Médano for the first time is the waves. Not many people are used to having to overcome a decent shore break with the beach start (as well as controlling the kit in the waves) or sailing on the ocean waves.
