Porto Botte is teaming with wildlife; the kite spot neighbours protected waterways where pink flamingos feed and dredge up food from salty pools that lie alongside the dirt road that takes you to the beach. This would make for some fantastic kiteboarding, but it is probably too shallow and is also protected due to the prestigious birdlife. But on the ocean side, there is epic flat water that allows you to push your freestyle. Areas of light seagrass keep the water butter-flat right up to the strongest of winds, and there is a flat water section on offer downwind of the land during the Mistral winds. The kite station (Kite Sardinia) also has shade and beach chairs to relax in between sessions, as well as snacks and cold drinks. Lessons are offered by the kite school Kite Paradiso speaking English, Polish, Italian, Russian. Learning is ideal, and rescue is available from the school for all beach users.
