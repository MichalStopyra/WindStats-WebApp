Karpathos is a paradise for wind addicts: Chicken Bay for beginners and Gun Bay for intermediates and experts. Here, everyone gets his or her moneys worth. Gun Bay is a true high-wind spot where you can let off steam and forget the rest of the world. The flat water near the shore is perfect for practicing jibes and the spit off the coast guarantees your safety. Those who are looking for a real challenge can surf out of Gun Bay to Paradise Bay - a bay which definitely deserves its name. Here the wind is about 1-2 Beaufort stronger and the perfectly flat water delivers superb blasting conditions. Due to an 80 meter wide shallow water area, Chicken Bay offers ideal conditions for beginners, intermediates and freestylers. The wind comes from the north-east and blows cross offshore from the left. The high wind in Gun Bay creates a 1 meter wind wave after 300 meters which is suitable for both jumping novices and experts. In Chicken Bay the wind also blows cross offshore but with 1-2 Beaufort less force.
