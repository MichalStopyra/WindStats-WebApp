Texel is on the west coast, and it is where the Kiteboarding World Cup stop in 2017 took place. It's a sandy beach that is perfect for freeride/freestyle spot but also can also get some waves. It is considered the busiest spot on the island, and it works with most of the wind, except the east.

Wind: Works well in all directions except east
Waves: Small waves
Shorebreak: None
