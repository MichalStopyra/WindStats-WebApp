Naxos island is one of the most consistently windy locations in the whole of Europe, especially during summer time and has more than 240 days blowing 15+ knots yearly. The Meltemi wind was known by the old Greeks as the Etesian (annual) northern winds and results from a high-pressure system (>1025) laying over the Balkan/Hungary area and a relatively low pressure (<1010) system over Turkey that is channelling jet-effect (venturi) between islands increasing the wind.  Furthermore, it can be characterized as one of the few Mediterranean winds that do not necessarily die out at the end of the day and can easily last more than three to six days and start over again. Especially where Naxos Kitesurf is located, the microclimate at the spot can't be predicted, and it's almost always 3-5 knots more than the rest of the island. The climate is naturally Mediterranean, with warm summers and relatively mild winters.
