Switzerland is not known as one of the windiest countries in the world, but Lake Silvaplana can be considered one of the windiest places in Switzerland! During the summertime (June to September) it's windy about 80% of the time and from October to May, about 50% of the time.

The lake is located in a narrow valley, so thermal winds and an additional venturi create the â€œMaloja wind". The wind usually starts to be kite-able (Twintip) at around 1 pm. From July and August, the wind kicks in around 11 pm, giving us some more time on the water! Generally, the wind starts slowly and pick up during the day, peaking from 3-5pm with about 20-25 knots before it drops around 6-7pm. The foilers can get in much longer days on the water, starting half an hour earlier and staying on much longer in the evening with 5-8 knots till late.
