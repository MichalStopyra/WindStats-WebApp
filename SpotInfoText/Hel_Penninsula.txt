Hel Peninsula consists of one of the biggest beginner-friendly lagoons around Poland. The shallow (waist deep) lagoon stretches from 500 to 1000m across the entire Peninsula. Clearwater, sandy bottom, no reefs, no significant tides changes, no sharks spottings and lot of space make this place perfect for beginners and intermediate riders.
Additionally, the positive, laid-back vibe and nearby accommodation at Chalupy’s campsite (located directly on the kite spot) makes this place mecca of polish kitesurfing and windsurfing scene. This spot works in all wind directions – with North and North-east winds you need to cross the street and go to the second beach, located at the open sea.
