The average water temperature in summer season (June to August) is around 18 degrees Celsius. Most kitesurfing schools open in April and close end of October due to the temperature. Zeeland isn’t known for thermic winds or wind systems continually blowing in the same direction. The North Sea spots usually have steady non-gusty winds because there are no obstacles; the wind comes right from the sea. It’s recommended to stay for at least one week to make sure you find enough windy days during your stay. In spring you will see mostly wind from northwest directions which usually will stay for a couple of days and in autumn the wind can get stormy when the wind direction turns southwest.
