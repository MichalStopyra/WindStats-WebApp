With more than 300 sunny days a year and the mild Pannonian climate, Lake Neusiedl is more than just a kite, windsurf and sailing hotspot, it is an enchanting place to relax and recharge your batteries from your daily routines.

The Lake Neusiedl is a steppe lake situated between the eastern parts of the Alps and the western part of the small Hungarian plain, named the “Seewinkel” – it is a steppe-national park. The national border between Austria and Hungary cuts right through the lake making it possible to kite in two different countries at the same time. The lake and its reed belt cover in total about 320 km², of which 4/5 are on Austrian, and 1/5 is on Hungarian territory.
