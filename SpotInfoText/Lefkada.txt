For five solid months a year, this area of the Ionian sea has the wonderfully smooth Maistro wind. This reliable daily wind starts to build around midday and then drops off at sunset, giving speeds between 15 to 20 knots.  In the mornings the sea conditions are like a mill pond, so you can either have a lazy morning or go SUPing before the Maistro arrives.  In the evenings you can kite until the sun goes down, which not only gives you a good long kiting session, but also some wonderful photo opportunities!

The wind starts in mid-May with about 75% probability, however, from June to the middle of September there are very few windless days, giving approximately 95% probability during these months!  The wind continues through until the end of September, but again, like in May, we are looking at about 75% probability as it declines to come into October.
