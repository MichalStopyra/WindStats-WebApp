Superb pointbreak, every wave sailors dream with long clean waves and cross to cross off shore winds.

In the middle of the north of Fuerte lies the small fishing village of Majanicho at a bay. In the bay is flat water, the waves break on the deep water reefs of eiter side of the bay where the left side has a lumpy wave, the righthander is long and clean ending in the bay. A very easy spot, on smaller days also very suitable for wavebeginners, on good days the wave links up from Acid Drop, about 800m upwind to the right, all the way to the bay. Depending on the tide Majanicho can hold up to mast and a half high waves, on huge days and low tide the wave can close out across the bay.
Mainly a winterspot when the trade winds come more from the east and reinforce through the channel between Lanzarote and Fuerteventura. Best period: from october till april.
