The Portuguese northerly wind is called “Nortada” and is the best friend of all kitesurfers from and travelling to the Algarve. We are blessed with this Nortada for almost every day from May until October, and during the high season, the nortada will howl over the Portuguese mountains until it reaches the Alvor lagoon with a speed of 13 to 30 knots. Mornings are usually calmer (wind wise) than afternoons which are perfect for beginners and more advanced kiters to spread out during the day and enjoy ideal conditions for the level they are at. Furthermore, the Algarve is blessed with more than 300 days of sun per year and the temperature during the high season can peak over 40 degrees (Celsius). Although sun intensity is pretty high, the wind gives a nice cooling feeling which makes the climate very pleasant, but also very dangerous to sunburn so we’d advise all travellers not to be shy with sunscreen.
