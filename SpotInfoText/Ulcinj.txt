This spot is a wide and long beach with a dark volcanic extra soft sand. There is nothing sharp around the beaches to worry about and as the old Montenegrins say, that this sand has healing properties!

From this spot, you can do a (7km) downwind sessions, where you finish at the rivers delta, with flat water between two sandbanks. Once that is done, it's time for beer session in the local beach bar!
