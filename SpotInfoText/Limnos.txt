The summer season runs from the middle of May to September. The Meltemi wind from the North is expected during this time. It goes in cycles, so you tend to get four days of wind per week, but you can get 7 out of 7 if you’re lucky (and only 1 or 2 if you’re not)! Things quiet down by October, and although colder and less reliable wind-wise, the winter season can make for some great kiting too.
