Among the best spots to learn windsurfing in Europe, Porto Pollo in northern Sardinia is located on a narrow peninsula and therefore leads into two distinct riding areas: the eastern shore is ideal for beginners because it is exposed to side-offshore winds providing very flat water, and is reserved to windsurfers. The western shore is wider and exposed to side-onshore winds and opened to everyone.
