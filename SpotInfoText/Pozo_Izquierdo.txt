Pozo Izquierdo in southeast Gran Canaria, close to Vecindario, offers reliable wind and waves throughout the year. A world-class windsurfing spot that challenges experienced windsurfers, it’s on the PWA (Professional Windsurfers Association) World Tour. Pozo’s long wave breaks to the right with on shore wind from the NE that is strongest during the summer.
