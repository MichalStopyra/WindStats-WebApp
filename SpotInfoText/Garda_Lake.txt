Lake Garda, especially the northern region, is considered one of the top locations for windsurfers because the wind required is guaranteed almost daily.
At the opening of the season, local surfers and guests eagerly wait with high expectations. It's also a particularly beautiful sight for spectators, as the season progresses, more and more colourful boards and boats dance on the lake.
The surfing Mecca is definitely Nago-Torbole, other popular surfing spots are found in Riva del Garda, Malcesine and Gargnano. Beginners and professionals can learn new techniques here as there are plenty of professional surf schools with courses for children and adults. And, there are plenty of specialised rental shops at the Lake, as well.
Gliding over the waters of Lake Garda is pure fun for all windsurfers!
