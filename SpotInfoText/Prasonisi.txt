Prasonisi beach is famous for its excellent geographical location, for its strong and stable Maltemi wind and for unique coast line making it possible to sail in diametrically different conditions in two different seas; the Aegean and the Mediterranean. These factors make it one of the most attractive and phenomenal places in the world for windsurfing and kiteboarding both at beginner and advanced level.
