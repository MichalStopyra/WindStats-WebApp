Loissin is one of Germany's sunniest places! The wind direction usually comes from the west over north to east in Loissin with nearby spots for other directions. The additional thermal effect makes wind from the east generally stronger than predicted, and there is a 60% wind probability.

The air temperature from April to October can range between 10-30°C and water from 10-20°C. Wetsuits are generally always recommended! People still kite here during the off-season, but you'll need a thick wetsuit, hood, shoes, and gloves!
